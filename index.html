    <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">The food options and responsibilities to 
      consider, canteens must be better organised and more effecint than they have been in the past. Online menus
       with photographs of the meals prepared, and detailed descriptions of their ingredients help both students and
       parents make the right nutritional choices.Each student or staff memeber who accesses the canteen could be
       provided with a School Canteen Account on the school website that keeps track of their previous meal choices 
       and any dietary requirements they may have. Ordering the online by ticking a box and paying for meals online can 
       eliminate all the fuss of money handling . Making it safer and less complicated for staff and students alike. 
       Here again, deversity is the key .  </p>
